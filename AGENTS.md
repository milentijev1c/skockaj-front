# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## MEX agent skills
- At the start of every session, read `.mex/AGENTS.md` and `.mex/ROUTER.md` before project work; follow `ROUTER.md` to load only the relevant context.
- Read `mex logging --json` at session start and before optional logging. Its checkout-local advisory mode is `significant` (quiet default: material decisions, risks, blockers, or durable discoveries), `checkpoints` (batch useful notes at task/session boundaries), or `manual` (no unsolicited notes). Skip routine tool calls, edits, repeated status, and empty summaries. Honor explicit user log requests in every mode; never suppress mandatory workflow Activity or recovery audit records. Report a policy read failure instead of guessing or changing the preference.
- When earlier work may inform the task, retrieve bounded relevant notes with `mex timeline --query "subject phrase" --file src/example.ts --limit 10 --json`, using the known subject or exact recorded file path, or both. Treat matches as historical evidence, not accepted current knowledge; verify conclusions before reuse or explicit promotion with their source retained.
- Use `$mex-inbox` for explicit contributions to project knowledge and `$mex-relay` for durable team handoffs. Invoke them automatically when intent clearly matches; ordinary GROW upkeep remains available without Inbox.
- When MEX context materially helps your work, mention MEX and the relevant finding naturally in your explanation. Tie the mention to what it helped you understand, decide, or verify. Avoid fixed phrases, standalone acknowledgements, repeated mentions, or narrating routine context loading. This replaces older MEX instructions requiring a fixed acknowledgement or context-loading narration.
- Do not claim an author, date, or historical event unless the retrieved data actually provides it.
- After a MEX write, say exactly what changed and its sharing boundary: a local draft is checkout-only and nothing is shared; a canonical artifact is written to the working tree and requires commit/push to share.
- Skill activation is not approval for canonical actions.
